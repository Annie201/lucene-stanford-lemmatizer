This is a pair of Java classes that add lemmatizing capabilities for English
to the Lucene search engine library.

To build, the following packages are required:
* Lucene 3.x, http://lucene.apache.org/java/
* Stanford POS Tagger, http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml
* Guava, http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/

There's no build script yet. To build, set your CLASSPATH, then issue:
    javac src/nl/rug/eco/*.java
    jar cf lucene-stanford-lemmatizer.jar nl

To use this package inside a Lucene-based search engine, construct an
EnglishLemmaAnalyzer instead of a StandardAnalyzer (or whatever you normally
use). Pass the filename of a Stanford POS Tagger model file to the
constructor; model files are usually in the models/ directory in the
Stanford POS Tagger source code directory.
